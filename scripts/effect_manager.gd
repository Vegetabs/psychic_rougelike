#What is an 'effect'?
#An effect is a (mostly) timed phenomena which either act as visual effects or provide status effects to entities
#These status effects can be either positive and negative (with negatives not always being bad)
#Effects can be self or environment applied
#Effects interact with entities by applying a status effect
#An example of a status effect would be a burning tile
